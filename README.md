## 📌 Overview

The **Stock Predictor** leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock data and forecast future stock prices. It utilizes datasets (Ex: `powergrid.csv`) and applies predictive modeling to generate stock price predictions.

---

## 💡 Technologies and Concepts

**Technologies:** `Python`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

**Concepts:** `Data Preprocessing`, `Machine Learning`, `Predictive Modeling`, `Time Series Analysis`

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Loading**: Reads and preprocesses stock data from CSV files.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices.
- **Environment Configuration**: Provides a `requirements.txt` for easy setup of dependencies.

## 📝 TODO
- Sharpen `predict.py` to produce better models
- Increase the scope of `predict.py` so that more financial datasets can be analyzed
- Create a basic front end to display data
- Develop a backend hosted on the cloud to display user-selected financial datasets
